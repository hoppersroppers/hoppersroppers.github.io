                    <p> I'm a one man band running this site, and it takes a decent amount of time and money to keep going. </p>
                   <p>If you represent a company and want to be affiliated with the best place on the internet to learn security, we are always looking for <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors</a>.

                  <p> If you are looking to <a href="partners.html">partner</a> with us we can work with you to get our site in front of your students, with your people as the instructors so you can teach them and track progress yourselves. Our material is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 license so feel free to use it for internal training. </p>

                <p> However, what we want most of all is that more students learn about this site so that they can take the course and learn the skills they need to succeed. That means the best thing you can do for us is link to us in your blogposts, tweet about us, or share our course to whoever could use it to learn or to teach. </p>
