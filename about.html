                <h2>Our Story So Far</h2>
                <p> In 2016 I was the training officer for my school's competitive cyber security team. I had the responsibility of creating training materials and teaching ~100 students the absolute fundamentals to get them up to speed so they could participate in CTFs with everybody else. I spent two years trying to figure out the perfect curriculum and eventually realized I need a scalable platform to provide direction and track the progress of that many students. </p>
		    
		<p> Four years of curriculum development later, Roppers Academy was born. My goal is for this site to become the best place on the internet for a beginner to take their first steps into the field. I already think that it is, but my goal is for this to become the place that everyone is confident recommending as their go-to. <b>It's been two years since the site launched and we are well on our way to achieving that first goal. </b> </p>
		    
		<p> Roppers is derived from a word I made up to describe people who write Return Oriented Programming (ROP) exploits. Most importantly, it rhymes with the name of Admiral Grace Hopper for when we call ourselves "Hopper's Roppers".

		<p>We are here to provide guidance to new students on their first steps of their journey into cyberspace and then send them off on their own, with a solid foundation and headed in the right direction. I hope to have given them the tools, techniques, community, and the hacker mentality required to address any problem that comes their way. </p>
