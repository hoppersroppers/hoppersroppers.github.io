                <p> You are here because you want to own your own training site. Full control over your data, your customers, and your content. Design the experience from top to bottom. Provide a tailored experience to your community. Charge what you want. Control your own distribution. </p>

<p> I have written a series of scripts and made changes to the source code of the Moodle LMS that allows me to provide you and your students with a tailored experience. With your assistance, I will set up a site for you that lets you teach and market your courses however you want, while automating onboarding, retention, and acquisition funnnels. During this process I will work as your system administrator and help you learn the ropes of running the site by yourself. If you do not want to focus on the technical side, I am available to run the servers from the background while you focus on what matters to you.</p>

                <h3>How to Get Your Courses On Your Site</h3>
                <p>I will set up your site as a subdomain on one of your existing domains. I will build a modified copy of the Moodle LMS on a server I own and customize it according to the forms you filled out. I will set myself up as a system administrator to help trouble shoot and do any custom work, so that you can remain focused on teaching and not on customizing how the site works on the backend. You can <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=3"> buy Themes </a> or hire designers to give the site the feel that you want, but basic branding and basic modifications can be handled in house. </p>
		    
		    <p> There is a fairly intuitive drag and drop builder right now, but I am working on an automatic import tool that can take a course from a series of flat files and build the course. Currently I only have the opposite, which take a course and turns it into an <a href="https://ctfbook.hoppersroppers.org/">SEO friendly website</a> or .pdf file. </p> <p> Custom certificates are easy to make, I just haven't added one yet. </p>

                <h3>Teach How You Want</h3>
                <p>The strength of this platform is you are able to control exactly what your students do and review their assignments. This allows teachers to provide a much higher value than recording videos that will be watched once, as you can work with individual students and help them improve. This personal touch allows much higher engagement and personal connection than a purely video course could ever provide. Of course, your site will have the capability to do all of the other things expected from an online course like quizzes, readings, and videos. </p>
		    <p> If you want to host access controlled videos, Vimeo Pro provides an excellent solution for that and it is trivial to embed them in the site. </p>

                <h3>Custom Analytics Drive Automatic Actions</h3>
                <p> You are able to embed your own analytics scripts directly into the site, allowing you all the insights that large platforms like Google Analytics allows. In addition, I have written custom scripts which automate onboarding, engagements, and retention emails based off user activity inside of the courses. There are also tools to allow you to identify modules that students are struggling with in order to guide your course development. Because you own the site, there are no limits to what you can do with your data. </p> <p> You can easily sell access to the platform with Convertkit or any of the sites meant for landing page optimization and things like that. I run my own site on a Bootsrap framework but you can do better. </p>
