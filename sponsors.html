                <h2>Corporate Sponsorship</h2>
                <p>Are you interested in affiliating your company or organization with the best place on the internet to learn cyber security fundamentals? I am very interested in finding corporate sponsorship so that we can continue to provide high quality training for free. Options include banners on the site or in the courses, including any content or videos you would like us to add, or really anything else you can think of.</p> <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:contact@hoppersroppers.org">contact@hoppersroppers.org</a> if you are interested in supporting us. </p>
                
             <h2>Patronage from the People</h2>
                <p> If you believe in the Roppers mission and want to support, I am able to accept recurring donations through Gumroad to go towards funding the site. Every dollar counts and goes towards making this the best place on the internet for a beginner. </p>
