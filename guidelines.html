<h3 id="1purpose">1. Purpose</h3>

<p>A primary goal of Roppers Academy is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>We invite all those who participate in this organization to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="2opencitizenship">2. Open Citizenship</h3>

<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>

<p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>

<p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. If you see someone who is acting to the detriment of our community, we want to know.</p>

<h3 id="3expectedbehavior">3. Expected Behavior</h3>

<p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:</p>

<p>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>

<h3 id="4unacceptablebehavior">4. Unacceptable Behavior</h3>

<p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:</p>

<p>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

<h3 id="5weaponspolicy">5. Weapons Policy</h3>

<p>Weapons are encouraged. However if you use a weapon to threaten anyone, expect to wake up in a hospital.</p>

<h3 id="6consequencesofunacceptablebehavior">6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and especially those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

<h3 id="7reportingguidelines">7. Reporting Guidelines</h3>

<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, notify a community organizer as soon as possible. All members of the community are expected to report any unacceptable behavior and if reporting will not stop the behavior in time to avoid a negative outcome, take immediate action.</p>

<p>Reports can be sent via any of the instant messaging platforms such as Slack, or to my personal email, d.m.devey@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Please let us know so we can help you.</p>

<h3 id="8addressinggrievances">8. Addressing Grievances</h3>

<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the staff with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>

<p>We will work with all parties to ensure the Code of Conduct is enforced. All decisions made by the staff is final.</p>

<h3 id="9scope">9. Scope</h3>

<p>We expect all community participants (organizers, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>

<p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
