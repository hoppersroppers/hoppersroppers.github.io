                <h2>The Purpose of Competition</h2>
                <p>While our main goal is the delivery of material that will educate and advance the capabilities of our Cyber Community, engaging in competitions push and enhance one’s capabilities like no course can do.
Competitions incorporate the application of learned skills and knowledge with compressed learning. There is room on all our teams for newcomers and experts alike. Training for and competing in events will provide valuable teamwork and collaboration skills. The vast majority of competitions take place remotely allowing collaboration with the experts who mentor (and compete with) each team.

This page is still in progress as Hopper’s Roppers expands and we look forward to competing with you.</p>

We are hoping to turn this team into a super group of competitors from a large number of teams who can compete on this team whenever they want to do an event their team doesn’t have the manpower for.
